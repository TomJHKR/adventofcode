## 📜 About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event where programming enthusiasts tackle coding challenges designed to improve problem-solving skills. Each day, a new problem is unlocked with two parts to solve.

This repository serves as a personal archive of my solutions and progress throughout the event. Feel free to browse, use, or adapt these solutions for learning purposes.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

I'm a cybersecurity professional, not a software developer, so don't expect the most elegant or efficient code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - I have tried to use native python without any addtional packages.
- **Tools**: 
  - Code editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  - Version control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```
